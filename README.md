# lrhenness/roboticsGUI

This project aims to create a web GUI front end for operating multiple robots using a stack consiting of the following:

* Web App: Python (PySimpleGUIWeb)
* Database: MySQL
* Robot Control: Arduino

Currently the scope of this project is restrained to bare essentials for functionality to complete tasks for an academic project. Feel free to repurpose or base other PySimpleGUI code on this.
