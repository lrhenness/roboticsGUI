        angular velocity: float from 0.001 to ???
        weekday: int from 1 to 7
        time: regex HH:MM:SS anytime - [0-2][0-9]\:[0-5][0-9]\:[0-5][0-9]
    - Database healthcheck
    - Database retrieve (or error on) highest "id" from table "DEPLOY"
    - Structure arrays into strings to send commands to Database
    - Send commands to database and check that they "made it there safely" for user
